# Advent-of-Code 2022
personal attempts at writing solutions to advent of code problems using haskell. 
mostly it's about how they are written, not about the problems themselves. 
indeed, a couple of solutions are almost entirely inspired by others' and I do not credit these as my own. 
they merely serve the purpose of practicing with monads, functors and arrows.
